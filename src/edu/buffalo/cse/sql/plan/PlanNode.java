/**
 * An abstract implementation of functionality common to all nodes in a 
 * relational query plan.  
 * 
 * Three more concrete subclasses of PlanNode are defined:
 *  - Leaf nodes correspond to base relations in the database (i.e., file or 
 *    index scan operators.
 *  - Unary nodes represent relational query operators that read from exactly
 *    one source relation (i.e. selection or projection nodes)
 *  - Binary nodes represent relational query operators that read from two
 *    source relations (i.e., union and join)
 * 
 * Classes for specific operators should implement 
 *  - any functionality required to store operator-specific information
 *    (e.g., the predicate of a selection).
 *  - the getSchema() method
 * 
 * Optionally, specific operators can override the default detailString() method
 * to provide an operator annotated with operator-specific information.
